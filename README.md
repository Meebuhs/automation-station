## Automation Station :robot::station:

This repo contains a collection of projects created as a means to practice an array of popular devops tools. Each project contains its own readme which outlines its` goals, usage instructions and references.

### Getting Started

All of the projects in this repository rely on some or all of Ansible, Molecule, Vagrant, Virtualbox and Docker. At some point I will likely include an ansible playbook to ensure these tools are installed but for now, if you are on an Ubuntu machine you can use the included `install.sh` script to install them.
